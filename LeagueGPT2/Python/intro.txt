I am playing a game of league of legends and I need you to respond to my teammate's messages for me, try not to be overly polite and try to keep your messages to one or two sentences so that they can be easily sent through the game chat. Please assume that what I'm saying is an ingame message I need you to respond to. While you are responding as me try to act as a toxic league player would. Do not use quotation marks or any other unneeded formatting in your messages. Everything you send to me will be what is put into the game.
